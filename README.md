# 🏏 Cricket AI Analyzer (Cricket AI Studio Pro)

Cricket AI Analyzer is an AI-powered desktop application that performs real-time cricket batting analysis using computer vision and pose estimation. The system extracts biomechanical metrics, estimates bat/arm/ball speed, detects shot phases, generates explainable coaching feedback, and automatically creates highlight clips through a modern PyQt-based user interface.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Sports Biomechanics in performance analysis and coaching assistance.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Real-time player detection and pose tracking (YOLOv8 Pose)
- Biomechanical analysis:
  - Elbow angle
  - Knee angle
  - Weight transfer (Front / Back / Balanced)
- Bat, arm, and ball speed estimation
- Explainable AI-based coaching feedback
- Shot phase detection:
  - Backlift
  - Downswing
  - Contact
  - Follow-through
- Automatic highlight generation per detected shot
- CSV-based analytics logging (research & report ready)
- Desktop application built with PyQt5

**
## 🧩 Core Modules**

- **Pose Engine** (`engine/pose_engine.py`)  
  Handles multi-person pose tracking, target locking, joint angle calculation, and weight transfer estimation.

- **Shot Segmenter** (`engine/shot_segmenter.py`)  
  Detects shot phases, identifies shot start/end, and buffers frames for highlights.

- **Speed Estimator** (`engine/speed_estimator.py`)  
  Estimates bat speed (wrist-based), ball speed (motion tracking), and arm speed (heuristic).

- **Coach Engine** (`engine/coach.py`)  
  Generates human-readable, rule-based coaching feedback using biomechanical thresholds.

- **Highlight Generator** (`engine/highlight_generator.py`)  
  Automatically saves highlight video clips for each completed shot.

- **CSV Logger** (`engine/csv_logger.py`)  
  Logs per-frame analytics including angles, speeds, shot phase, and coaching feedback.

- **Central Engine** (`engine/engine.py`)  
  Orchestrates all modules and acts as the main processing pipeline.

- **UI Layer** (`app.py`)  
  PyQt5-based desktop interface for live visualization, metrics display, coaching feed, highlights, and logs.
